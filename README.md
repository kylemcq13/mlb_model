Create a reddit sentiment analyzer of all game threads - is it possible to set up an automated model to analyze the sentiment of each game's comments? Explore the possibilities of this.
- To do this, I could collect data from all the game threads this season. It would be a tedious and long task, but acquiring the data wouldn't be that hard. With this data, a BERT sentiment analyzer could be built and the results shared with the Reddit thread which could be... interesting. This could be an insightful post and could bring some humor to the portfolio site. 

Have a look at the fangraphs community research page, lots of example projects that would be a good fit with my skillset. One of the articles on there classified Yu Darvish's pitches using decision trees. Could do something very similar with a White Sox pitcher - thinking Dylan Cease... this could evolve into a universal pitch classifier which may be more useful to someone working in the MLB.

Another piece that could be explored is Dallas Keuchel's downfall... what is going on? Can you identify what the issue is through data? 

Yasmani Grandal is having a crazy season - could be another piece to explore. What makes him so special? 

Markov Model is still very much in play and could be fun to explore and beneficial to the portfolio. 

Many other examples on here for inspiration - check out the articles and scope out an article I could write for the portfolio site.
